*** EasySync / EasyDeploy Databases ***

There are two demo databases included:

• FM_Surveys_Hosted: The hosted database.
• FM_Surveys_Mobile: The mobile database.
• EasyDeploy: The EasyDeploy “helper” database that facilitates the downloading and installation of upgrades.



*** EasySync FileMaker Accounts ***

There are four accounts setup in both the hosted and mobile “EasySync” databases:

Account Name: Admin
Password: fmezsync
Privilege Set: Full Access

Account Name: User1
Password: fmezuser1
Privilege Set: Data Entry Only

Account Name: User2
Password: fmezuser2
Privilege Set: Data Entry Only

Account Name: ezdeploy
Password: makeitso
Privilege Set: EasyDeploy (Extremely limited access. Can only run the “Return Requested Deployment Segment” script.)
Note: Used for EasyDeploy integration.



*** EasyDeploy FileMaker Accounts ***

There are two accounts setup in the EasyDeploy databases:

Account Name: ezdeploy
Password: makeitso
Privilege Set: Data Entry Only
Note: The file is set to open automatically with this account.

Account Name: Admin
Password: fmezdeploy
Privilege Set: Full Access
Note: Hold down the option (or alt) key when opening the file to bypass the default account.



*** Configuring the EasySync Demo Database ***

In order to sync with your copy of the hosted demo database, you need to configure the mobile database so that the "Hosted_Database" external data source points to your FileMaker Server. ( File > Manage > External Data Sources ) 

Then see the Documentation page on the EasySync Web site ( http://fmeasysync.com ) for information on how to wire up a few of the remote scripts that are called in the mobile database.
